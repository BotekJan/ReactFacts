# React Facts

This is a static react page built as the outcome of Section 1 of freeCodeCamp's [Learn React JS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4rFhThSX04&t=3614s) course on YouTube.

## Overview
This simple project serves as a refresher on the basics of React, covering fundamental concepts like:

- **JSX (JavaScript XML)**: A syntax extension that allows writing HTML-like code in JavaScript.
- **ReactDOM.render()**: Renders React elements to the DOM.
- **Functional Components**: Simple functions that return JSX to define UI elements.
- **Component Composition**: Combining multiple components to build a UI.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keeping UI elements modular and reusable via components.
- **CSS Styling**: Using external CSS files to style React components.

## Personal Note

A great warm-up that got me excited to dive deeper into React with the upcoming projects in the course.
